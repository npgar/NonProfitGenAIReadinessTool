# Non-Profit GenAI Readiness Tool Overview
This tool is designed to assess a non-profit's readiness to implement GenAI technologies and applications. This tool accounts for the uniqueness of both GenAI and non-profit organizations. Following a structured readiness assessment process helps the non-profit identify strengths, gaps, and priorities to maximize potential impact while minimizing risks associated with GenAI implementations. Our tool is designed to help non-profit's assess their GenAI readiness before (not after) implementing GenAI solutions. Doing so will help the non-profit determine if they have the foundations to be successful with their GenAI implementations. Obviously, scoring high on our tool cannot guarentee success, but our research suggests that scoring high will increase the non-profit's chances of success. Scoring low on certain categories will help the non-profit structure their readiness efforts in specific areas such as people, process, or culture.

# Users
This tool can be used by any non-profit employee who is involved in the GenAI readiness assessment process at a non-profit organization. We suggest non-profit's seek input from staff across different levels when assessing their GenAI readiness because staff at different levels have different insights regarding the capabilities of the non-profit organization. Younger staff, for instance, may have a better understanding of GenAI technologies and applications relative to older executives at the non-profit. therefore, it is important to seek input across the non-profit and not just the senior leadership team.

# Non-Profit Sector
Certain questions are related to the social mission of the non-profit, so one important bouandary condition is that the non-profit must have a social or non-financial mission. Otherwise, those questions will not be relevant. With that said, however, our tool is designed to be sector agnostic even though we constructed the tool using data from a case study of two health-care related non-profit organizations. That is, an Ocean cleanup or a healthcare related non-profit may potentially benefit from using our tool. We deliberately designed the items and questions to be broadly applicable to non-profits across sectors that have social instead of finaincial missions. 

# Size or Business Model of Non-profit
Non-profit organizations obviuously come in all shapes and sizes with different sources of funding and operating models. Non-profits may also range in organizational complexity and size. Some non-profits, for instance, only have two or three people while others are multi-national containing thousands of employees and volunteers. Our tool will be most helpful for non-profit organizations that are large enough to face the many types of people, process, and technology issues associated with GenAI implementations. Many of the questions on our tool may not be relevant for non-profits that only contain one or two people. With that said, small non-profits may still benefit from discussing certain questions on the tool even if all of them are not applicable.

# Suggested Process of Using our Tool
Step 1: Decide who should be involved in the GenAI readiness assessment process. We recommend that this process include staff at all levels with different responsibilities (e.g., operational, tactical, and strategic).

Step 2: Have all individuals involved in the GenAI readiness assessment process answer the questions in this Excel file independently.

Step 3: Have each assessor send their results to a coordinator or the person in charge of the GenAI assessment process at the non-profit.

Step 4: The coordinator should then organize a meeting to debate and discuss the results from each assessor. 

NOTE: A successful use of our tool is one that elicits rich conversations and healthy debate. It is better for the non-profit to admit that they are not ready than to implement GenAI before they have the foundations for success.

# Excel File Instructions
1) Enable all warning messages and macros when opening the workbook.
2) Answer the questions on the INPUTS worksheet. Only modify the cells in light gray. All other cells should be locked.
3) Select the DASHBOARD worksheet to view the readiness results. Each time you click on the DASHBOARD worksheet, the dashboard gets refreshed.

# Operating System Requirements
We tested the solution on both MACs and PCs using Office 365.

# Version and Published Manuscript
We are in the process of attempting to publish a manuscript corresponding to this tool, but the publication process is excessively long. The version of the tool that corresponds to that manuscript should it get published is v13. Please keep in mind that future versions may add, remove, or reorganize the items as both non-profits and GenAI technologies and applications evolve.
