# NonProfitGenAIReadinessTool
This tool is designed to assess a non-profit's readiness for GenAI technologies and applications. This tool accounts for the uniqueness of both GenAI and non-profit organizations.
Following a structured readiness assessment process helps the non-profit identify strengths, gaps, and priorities to maximize potential impact while minimizing risks associated with GenAI implementations.

# Users
This tool can be used by any non-profit employee who is involved in the GenAI readiness assessment process at a non-profit organization. We suggest non-profit's seek input from staff across different levels when assessing their GenAI readiness because staff at different levels have different insights regarding the capabilities of the non-profit organization. Younger staff, for instance, may have a better understanding of GenAI technologies and applications relative to older executives at the non-profit.

# Non-Profit Sector:
Our tool can be used by any non-profit. We built the tool from a case study of two large non-profits that support nurses. However, no questions are specific to non-profit's in this sector.

# Size of Non-profit:
Our tool will be most helpful for non-profit organizations that are large enough to face the many types of people, process, and technology 
issues associated with GenAI implementations. Many of the questions on our tool may not be relevant for non-profits that only contain one or two people.
With that said, small non-profits may still benefit from discussing certain questions on the tool even if all of them are not applicable.

# Suggested Process:
Step 1: Decide who should be involved in the GenAI readiness assessment process. We recommend that this process include staff at all levels with different responsibilities (e.g., operational, tactical, and strategic).
Step 2: Have all individuals involved in the GenAI readiness assessment process answer the questions in this Excel file independently.
Step 3: Have each assessor send their results to a coordinator or the person in charge of the GenAI assessment process at the non-profit.
Step 4: The coordinator should then organize a meeting to debate and discuss the results from each assessor. 

# Excel File Instructions:
1) Answer the questions on the INPUTS worksheet. Only modify the cells in light gray.
2) Select the DASHBOARD worksheet to view the readiness results. Each time you click on the DASHBOARD worksheet, the dashboard gets refreshed.
